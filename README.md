# Deep-Learning-Models
This repository includes a set of various Deep learning models ranging from the basic fully connected network to complicated networks like RNN and CNN 

The datasets used here is the MNIST dataset available in the Tensorflow library

The models are: 

1. Fully Connected Deep Neural Network
2.RNN Model
