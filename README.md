# Deep-Learning-Models
This repository includes a set of various Deep learning models ranging from the basic fully connected network to complicated networks like RNN and CNN 

The datasets used here is the MNIST dataset available in the Tensorflow library

Description of files: 

1. tf1 : A simple example of fully connected deep neural network using the MNIST dataset

2. tf_sentiment_analysis: Sentiment Analysis using the NLTK library and Tensorflow on the set of tweets. 

3. tf_RNN : RNN implementation using the MNIST Dataset

4. tf_CNN : CNN implementation using the MNIST Dataset

5. tflearn_demo : CNN implementation on MNIST Dataset using tflearn library
